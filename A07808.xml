         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

As no man can be ignorant either of the controuersies of this time in matters of religion, or that the state of the recited difficulties (to answere their aduersaries) is the case of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, disgraced, silenced, and persecuted in England: So that the former, of corruptions, falsyfications, &amp; joyned with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and liberty of speech and writing, to promote their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, is a thing frequently vsed of English Protestant Doctors, wil sufficiently (euen by their owne present testimonies) appeare in this Treatise. Then resolution is easily made, by what meanes, by way of learning, that religion is maintained.</p>

Higgons</hi> (a late Minister among them, leauing them and becomming a Catholike by such their corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions) and to three great personages, his Majesty, the right ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Earle of Salisbury Lord Treasurer, and the Lord Eurc the Lord President of Wales, absolutely justifieth himselfe in wordes to be a <hi>professed publisher of truth,</hi> and no <hi>falsyficator,</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupter, or such wicked dealer: and is so not only valued by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but likewise esteemed of (as I vnderstand) by most and many his Protestant readers and auditors. Therefore before al others I haue made choise of this man, so sincere and of such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, by so great Protestant applause. I haue made choise before al others of his writing, to examine the principal part of his booke named by him, <hi>A ful satisfaction;</hi> because in this he <note place="margin">Ful satisfact epist. dedicat.</note> protesteth to our Soueraigne, most great and rare sincerity from such crimes: and intituleth his booke <hi>A ful satisfaction,</hi> which in sincerity and true dealing, must be deuoide of al cunning, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and counterfait behauiour, which doe offend and scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize, and neither fully nor at al satisfie honest minded readers. Againe, I haue chosen this booke, because it, was written, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, published, and by great Protestants priuiledged, (if not hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in composing) in time of Conuocation. And further, I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:26352:3"/> choose this, not only because it was written against my selfe Authour of the <hi>Moderate answere</hi> to his positions: but in respect he complaineth in his <hi>Preamble,</hi> why I had not written against that, his named <hi>ful satisfaction</hi> also: speaking as though I had got a scratch (some foile he meaneth) at his handes, neither refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting vpon any vnworthinesse in his owne worke, or difficulty which Catholike Students in England haue to publish little, though they write much, and often with no great ease or his helps to aide them. But although I neuer judged (as I shal hereafter demonstrate) that his booke to be any satisfaction to my answere, nor of it selfe worth my labour to confute; yet (as I can proue <note place="margin">Morton Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amb. chap. of Stage, &amp;c.</note> by many witnesses) I had censured both that, and his <hi>Preamble</hi> also, within six weekes (and lesse) of their first birth; And my prints prouided taken or hindered (one of those my bookes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne to be printed) I had no meanes to publish either, vntil his bookes were out of date (as neuer in much) or were otherwise answered. Whether I feare any Protestants scratch in schooles or no, he may know, if they wil graunt vs disputation, now they deny vs printing. And I not only for these reasons doe now cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure him, but because in his Preamble it pleaseth him to bring me vpon the stage (as he calleth it) to play a part with his Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man aduersary, and himselfe: where although I doe not finde, that I am either scratched or bitten vvith his nailes or teeth, though bawled and barked at with his tongue, as <hi>Latrantes</hi> vse. Yet now I am enforced to enter the stage; and I feare his part wil proue to be that, which his Greeke name signifieth, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in Comedies and Tragedies Actors be chosen, to make better resemblance of thinges.</p>
            <p>I also choose that part of his booke not only because it is the first in order: But is the defence and propugnacle of the very ground of al his writing against vs, in that kinde, as himselfe hath <note place="margin">Rom. pos. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</note> written, and that failing al his building is ouerthrowne. Againe, I choose his defence of that maine argument; because it contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth more of my booke, then any other, and more then many of some of the rest. And yet notwithstanding al this, and more causes, vrging or rather (by his behauiour) necessitating me to <note place="margin">Morton against Higg. ep. dedic.</note> write, I could haue beene silent (hoping better of him hereafter)
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:26352:4"/> but that I see him newly glory of his innocency, and singular sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in this behauiour, whereof I am to accuse him: and busie himselfe further (as I am informed) then either honour or tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph wil be his reward.</p>
            <p>Therefore to passe ouer other authorities, partly because he <note place="margin">D. Mortons corruptiō how great in that first part of his booke to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, and proued in this Treatise.</note> hath heard of his sincerity in them before, as also they are not so easie to be examined of ordinary readers: I wil omit al thinges whereof he hath beene by others admonished, and take leauings, only his citations of my writing in that his sincere part of <hi>ful sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,</hi> (as he tearmeth it) and directly demonstrate not only that among al those (being many) there is not one which is not either fasly and corruptly cited or applied, but often times in one citation diuers and sundry corruptions, and such like abuses, are committed by this man of sincerity: and not one citation among them al, to be found free from such dealings.</p>
            <p>Neither by ending my examination there, doe I free any of his arguments, or citations following, but end there at this time, only for my (before) alleaged reasons. And if it shal be needful <note place="margin">D.

Wherein (to giue an vndoubted patterne of a perfect Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Professor) I now vndertake to proue likewise of al his cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of my writing following, that among them al, there is not one among foure, which is free from corruption, falsifying, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting, or some such abusing. I doe not absolutely say that al following without exception be such, (but not one among foure to be f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

First, in his <hi>Preamble</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Mortō Preamb. pag. 50. 62.</note> charged by a Catholike aduersary to challenge (if he could) any one Catholike writer of this wickednesse objected against him, though I was then fresh in his memory, and next at his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow for the bookes written betweene vs, yet he leaueth me quite out, as freed from al such accusation.

For in his booke of posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <note place="margin">Mort. positions hath about 90. citat.</note> there be not one hundred of testimonies alleaged: Then I haue not examined fiue, or else the whetstone belongeth to <hi>D.

            <p>And first concerning the Title of your booke, <hi>(A ful satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction:)</hi> In the very first page and inscription thereof, it being <note place="margin">Mortons reply in titul.</note> by you deuided into three partes: you say (to vse your owne wordes) <hi>The two former belong to the reply vpon the Moderate answerer:</hi> Then I demaund of you, M. Doctor Satisfier, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to satisfie an argument, reason, booke, author, aduersary, or opponent, is not (at the least) to shew some insufficiency, inualidity, or defect in it, or in any wise to say somewhat vnto them: otherwise they remaine both vnanswered, and vnsatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as also vntouched and vunamed, euen as they did before: And a ful satisfaction must consequently, fully, and to al pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, satisfie: And ridiculous it were, so to be named, if it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed no such thing, otherwise it can not be a ful, but no satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: things, for al that, remaining as they did before, and wholy and fully vnsatisfied.</p>

And although, that third part which among foure you haue chosen to answere, and said somewhat vnto, is the greatest of al, yet the other being of such consequence for Catholikes, as I haue shewed (and wil more hereafter appeare) and vtterly condemning your position, it was neither ful satisfying dealing, sincerity or integ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:26352:11"/> to gather the number of the lines, which he hath cited and where (not exceeding mine in greatnesse and number of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) to make a perfect proofe or disproofe of <hi>A ful satisfaction,</hi> (if his reply were fully satisfactory:) which I recompt in this order. In his Epistle dedicatory he reciteth six or seauen lines, In defence of his first reason and chiefest (which I examine) 83. lines. in the 2. reason 47. in the third 26. in the fourth 40. in the fift 8. or 9. in the sixt 47. in the seauenth 13. in the eight 11. in the ninth 26. in the tenth 10. Then to delude his reader he deuiseth an other part of his booke, out of al or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by his owne first writing, calling it <hi>Iustification of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants:</hi> (wherein what vile disloyalties be defended by this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser of Catholikes, I leaue to others) And in that he citeth ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one hundred. Al which collected together (and be al he vouchsafeth to acquaint the world with from my booke, by such men and their meanes suppressed) doe not make 400. not the fift of my booke as is euident before. Then no satisfaction, much lesse a ful satisfaction. But it is my answere, and not his reply, which hath fully satisfied, and stil remaineth by him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied, euen by his owne judgement; except one is more then foure, or foure fewer then one: though his counter-coine (as I shal shortly demonstrate it to be) might passe for true paiment and satisfaction. And if M.

            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>How</hi> D. MORTON <hi>concealeth without any mention at al, both the oath of alleageance to Prince, and loue to al Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant subiects, as if they were of our owne religion, and as farre as the law of God, nature, and would together with a disputation, offered for Catholikes: and prouing them innocent.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>ANd M. Doctor, that it may be manifest, I doe not charge you for concealing and passing ouer, either without satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction or any memory at al, thinges of smal moment but of greatest consequence, and fully satisfying (because it is your phrase) al indifferent mindes, both of the sincere and loyal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to Superiours, and holy Doctrine in Catholikes, and falsly suggested crimination of you, against them: I beseech you to remember that your positions were grounded vpon sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed doctrine, and practise of Catholikes denial, of dutiful alleageance to Prince, and yeelding communications of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and ciuil respects, to Protestant subjects in their degree. And if we graunt al these, then al your positions, reply, defence of them, and your baptized ful satisfaction be out of date. And if you knew it in your owne conscience, and by testimony of your owne Protestants, and my writing, and yet you concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it from the world; as though I had neuer written to such purpose, and you by that meanes perseuered in your former calumniations, (as you did in your reply) we are to be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced innocent: and your selfe proued to be such a man, as I doe intitle you. And that we were thus innocent, and you thus guilty, euen in your owne knowledge, thus I presume against you; first in that, you know no Catholike teacheth that equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation <note place="margin">No Catholike can equiuocate in any point of religion, by any Catholike opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> or concealed meaning, may be vsed in matter of faith and religion, such as <hi>expresse dogmatical principles</hi> (your first and againe vrged positions in your judgement) are to be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. And to hold otherwise was the heretical excuse and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctize of your <hi>Cranmer,</hi> as I proued against you from your friend <note place="margin">Moder. ansvv. c. equiu.</note> and father <hi>Fox.</hi> Then much lesse may any Catholike dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or equiu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cate, in oath in such businesse, which you wel
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:26352:12"/> knew, by the lamentable losses and extremities, of those of our religion, about the oath of Supremacy in late daies, and later how prepared many were in this time of his Majesty in a case not so cleare, then in some judgements to suffer the like, had not his gratious Clemency and most honourable Councel, more pittied our distresses, then you and such Teachers of Diuinity had perswaded. Then hearken vnto your owne confession, concerning doctrine: your owne wordes vnto me, are these: <note place="margin">Mortons reply pag. 23.</note>
               <hi>If al your sect would allow your answere, we should neede no cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</hi> And thus againe: <hi>But to conclude with your owne wordes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 14.</note>
               <hi>those duties are not to be denied vnto Protestants. It were wel, if either you writ, as you thought, or that your Doctors did thinke, as you write: and so should we haue lesse cause of scruples to feare, either you or them.</hi> Good M. Doctor hitherto your wordes, and I pray remember, it is a matter of religion, by your owne confession, wherein you know, I speake as I thinke, and thinke as I speake, and that what I write hath beene thought likewise by other our Doctors, euen from Rome it selfe, as your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble <note place="margin">Mitigat. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble.</note> telleth me. The like you haue heard often times from your owne brethren in print of late both Doctors with you, and Bishops aboue you. Wherefore, good <hi>D. Thomas,</hi> be not you alone incredulous, but beleeue me. At the least I hope you wil be perswaded if you had knowne, we would haue sworne as I taught and writ. Then hearken againe what you knew and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed in my writing, without <hi>ful satisfaction:</hi> In that dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Epistle which you wholy concealed, I offered, and by war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for al English Catholikes in these wordes: <hi>We wil s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>protest, promise, and performe to your Maiesty, whatsoeuer loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, obedience, and duty, is due from a subiect to his temporal Prince, by the word of God, law of nature, or hath beene vsed by the subiects of this Kingdome, to any your Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>genitors Christian, from the first to the last: Acknowledge and render to your honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Counsaile, and al Magistrates in ciuil causes, so much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, reuerence, and submission: And to al other Protestant sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, like amity, and neighbourly affection, as if they were of the same religion, which we professe.</hi> Hitherto the oath of allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance which I offered with allowance: and it containeth the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:26352:12"/> plaine contradictory to that which he laboured to proue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs: and the same doctrine affirmatiue, which he acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted before for sufficient, to stoppe his and such mens feares, clamours, and scruples. And promiseth as much, as the law of God, of nature, and the law of duty in England allow, to Prince, and al kinde of Protestant subjects: and as much as to those of our owne religion, in those combinations, which he slaundered vs, to deny to al Protestants. In ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral he could not, neither doth wish for more: And that we might haue agreed in the particulars without such hisse, and like exploded clamours, we offered euen in that time of Parliament, Conuocation, and assembly of their best lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, a conference and disputation to our owne great inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and al Protestants ful satisfaction, If any thing wil sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie, but those thinges, which without sinne can neither be graunted of vs, or desired of them: and such as must needes haue accorded this contention, as I shal declare hereafter in this Chapter.</p>
            <p>What man then, of such sincere integrity, as this Doctor is, by his owne writing, and himselfe commended, would haue dissembled and concealed offers, and conditions so ample, general, so confidently made, and (himselfe confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it) stopping al clamours, and quieting contention in so great businesse? who would not shame to perseuer in that, which he knoweth a wrong? if my doctrine was so satisfactory, why was my poore person so persecuted, and extraordinarily searched for? my bookes so pleasing, and ful of contentment, why were they suppressed? why were such proceedings (as stil are) vrged against vs al by the Protestant Clergy? why did such spirits as this, so vnnaturally incense the Parliament against vs, that the Protestant Prelates made res<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>stance, as Protestants themselues haue published. The wordes of the Protestant Authours, of <hi>A Christian and modest offer,</hi> in that respect, are these. <hi>Resistance was made to the lawes inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi>
               <note place="margin">Christian and modest offer, pag. 15.</note>
               <hi>to haue beene made against the Papists, especially by some and those not the meanest of the Prelates.</hi> Whereby <hi>M. Morton</hi> may see diuers things, in his owne judgement against himselfe:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:26352:13"/> first, that Catholike Priests neither deserue their clamours, nor persecutions: secondly, how vnjustly he hath behaued himself, as wel in concealing from his readers, that which excuseth them for innocent, as in so passionate inuectiues against them, whom he thus esteemeth and findeth guiltlesse: thirdly, how religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and charitably his fellowes in profession vrged such lawes and proceedings against vs, and many (by his owne confession vnjustly) and stil prosecute, which some of their owne <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Prelates</hi> are ashamed off, made resistance against.</p>
            <p>And because <hi>M. Morton</hi> is a great man, and Doctor in his religion, let me further conferre with him in this matter of so great moment: Sir, your calling doth or should vnderstand, that although there is not euidence in faith, yet for the reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God, in which it is founded, it is called (and so is) the greatest certainty, then men which may not <hi>Mortonize,</hi> and haue no certainty of faith, cannot easily be remoued in judgement in such thinges: and to seeke the contrary by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion, without instruction, is <hi>but tiranny,</hi> as (if you were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent) you heard preached before the King, by the then Bishop <note place="margin">Bish. of Durh. Sermon. 19. of March, 1603.</note> of Durham, the 19. day of March in the yeare 1603. or if you were absent, I doubt not but you haue heard, or read, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties speach in Parliament, the same day, where he citeth and <note place="margin">Kinges speach in Parliament, 1603.</note> commendeth the same sentence: his regal wordes are these: <hi>For as you my Lord of Durham, said very learnedly to day in your sermon, correction without instruction is but tiranny.</hi> And a litle before he perswadeth vs thus: <hi>to be studious to reade and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre with learned men:</hi> by vvhich hee meaneth the learned Protestants.</p>
            <p>Then M. Doctor, I suppose you haue seene it lately proued, <note place="margin">Protest. proofs cap. 6. 8.</note> forth of your owne bretheren of England, which haue written since his Majesties entrance, and your selfe for one, that you Protestants in England haue not yet resolued anything in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith, which is infallibly certaine, (as faith must be) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by your proceedings haue you any such rule in religion, to resolue it by, <hi>or to binde others to receaue it,</hi> as <hi>D. Field</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, <note place="margin">Field pag. 226. 228.</note> and your selfe is not of other minde, when you know that matters of question in religion (where agreement cannot be

            <p>Now I wil make this matter more plaine in particular, and yet follow so friendly a course also in this combat, that I intend only to take the leauings of his Roman aduersary, and not bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>D.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:26352:17"/> grosly ignorant, vnlearned, and forgetful in so high degree, that he is vtterly vnworthy to write of diuine matters, to be credited in his Assertions, or to receaue any further answere hereafter.</p>
            <p>For proofe whereof, in his reply to my second chapter men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before (for the first as I haue declared, he neuer men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth) thus he behaueth himselfe: There be in that chapter 255. lines, and he proposing this to be his methode, to cite my writing, word for word, as he would perswade his reader, by the manner of his proceedings, maketh but 83. lines by his citation, and yet they doe not exceede in number of characters, those which be in my answere, both this and his reply being printed in quarto, and yet sometimes he citeth one thing twice, as the first and sixt chapter of his booke doe witnesse in this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: <note place="margin">Reply cap. 1. 6. pag. 1. 14.</note> So that before I complaine further, first he hath not ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or handled the third part of my answere, to that his Reason or Syllogisme.</p>
            <p>Secondly, citing my answere in this chapter in 14 seueral citations, he citeth not any one of them al without corruption, or falsyfication, more or lesse, which wil fully satisfie, that his sirnamed <hi>ful satisfaction</hi> is, as I haue tearmed it, and himselfe that man which I haue promised to proue him. And this I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate by induction and particular conuiction of euery one of these his citations, diuers containing many corruptions.</p>
            <p>And thus I proceede in examining his first citation, in the first chapter of his reply: At the first beginning he misquote<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In his reply to my second citation, he alleageth me vsing these wordes: <hi>No Papist doth iudge any Protestant an Heretike</hi>

               <hi>or excommunicate.</hi> Where we see he hath changed the nature of the question againe, from a conjunctiue proposition <hi>(Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants are Heretikes and excommunicate)</hi> which himselfe vseth before, and to which, and no other I answered, into a disiun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue proposition <hi>(Heretike or excommunicate:)</hi> betweene which there is so great difference, that the first is not true, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept both parts be true, the second is true, if one part only be such: as appeareth in these propositions: <hi>Thomas Morton</hi> is a Protestant Doctor, and a corrupt writer: <hi>Thomas Morton</hi> is a Protestant Doctor, or a corrupt writer. The latter proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being a disiunctiue is true, if <hi>M.

            <p>Againe M. Doctor, your citation consisteth only of 9. lines, and yet a part of them is your owne, &amp; not my wordes: is it then likely, that either eight or fiue argumēts (to vse your phrase) are truly &amp; substantially alleaged in so short a breuiate? And further

            <p>And in these citations you further behaue your selfe with this sincerity, M.

            <p>Neither is this sincere disputer and learned Doctor, fully sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with these so odious corruptions, in this one citation,

            <p>But M.

            <p>Now M.

Your wordes be these in the beginning of your reasons. <hi>The first reason: Their</hi>

               <hi>general assumption, wherupon al their rebellious positions are foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, is this, that al Protestants are Heretikes, and excōmunicate.</hi> This M. Doctor I thinke you make as a supposition, and not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent in any argument, for it is thus alone set by it selfe. And yet, if it were your Antecedent, you must needes graunt me, that your last citation is false: first, because in your positions you cal it <hi>their general assumption,</hi> which word <hi>(general)</hi> you know cōprehendeth al, and excludeth none: and yet in this place you
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:26352:23"/> only name it <hi>the cōmon censure</hi> (or opinion) <hi>of Papists.</hi> Which is not the same, with your former, because besides the common censure and opinion, there be often many or diuers o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hers, and not condemned. Secondly M. Doctor, in your first assertion, you make it only the assumption of <hi>Priests,</hi> to make them only worthy of death, here you cal it <hi>the common censure of Papists,</hi> making Papists, not Priests, as deepe in these positions as Priests, and so worthy of equal punishment. Then Sir I pray you, how doth this agree with your late <hi>Preamble,</hi> where you <note place="margin">Morton Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble pag. 36.</note> haue these wordes? <hi>I write against our aduersaries</hi> (Papists or Priests) <hi>but not without note of difference and distinction, being</hi>

               <hi>verily perswaded that diuers euen of the zealous amongst them, doe abhorre such doctrines and practizes, as haue beene discouered in the cases of rebellion and equinocation.</hi> Now Sir, here you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse <hi>diuers euen of the zealous</hi> of our religion, then generally your doctrine is not true, and your latter interpretation of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists common censure,</hi> is like to be as false.</p>
            <p>And to make euident demonstration againe, that you haue ouerthrowne your <hi>expresse dogmatical principles,</hi> in the cited place of your <hi>Preamble,</hi> you note in the margine in these wordes: <hi>A difference of Romish Professors, concerning the case</hi>
               <note place="margin">Preamble pag. 36. in marg.</note>
               <hi>of rebellion.</hi> Therefore seing you are a Doctor, and wil speake like a Scholler, only calling them <hi>Professors,</hi> or <hi>Romish Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,</hi> which be Doctors, Priests, and Diuines, as the manner of speaking is, you doe exclude diuers Romish Professors, from holding those opinions which you cal <hi>expresse dogmatical prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> which be such (as before) that no Professor may deny them. Therefore your <hi>expresse dogmatical principles</hi> by your owne sentence are expresly ouerthrowne. And M. Doctor, further if that assumption were your Antecedent▪ you haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted two other errours in your citation; first you leaue out the word <hi>(al)</hi> which altereth the proposition: secondly, you haue clipped away these wordes <hi>(and excommunicate:)</hi> in which by your owne interpretation, the force of al consisted. For if men be Heretikes, and yet not excommunicate, or not so excommunicate, that they are to be depriued of ciuil socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and al your arguments be fallacies, and conclude nothing.</p>
            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:26352:23"/>
            <p> And this I demonstrate, by your owne Antecedent, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by your selfe, which is in this manner: After you had in your positions set downe the assumption, of which I haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated: in your first Syllogisme you expound it for your Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent thus, and in these wordes: <hi>They who by their slaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi>

               <hi>doctrine make al Protestants (in their common censure Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes) so odious and vnworthy of any ciuil or natural society, must necessarily be adiudged seditious and intollerable amongst the Protestants:</hi> This is your owne Antecedent M. Doctor, or your interpretation thereof, word for word: recited in the same place, where you named that general assumption. And imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately following the same, only with these conuecting wordes betweene them: <hi>Now then we may argue, first:</hi> after which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth <note place="margin">Pag. 1. sup.</note> your recited interpretation of your Antecedent, which you make the first proposition of your first Syllogisme; And then recite the second proposition thus: <hi>But the Romish Seminaries</hi>
               <note place="margin">Supr. pag. 1.</note>
               <hi>and Iesuites, doe brand al Protestants with detestable crimes: thereby to deny them al ciuil or natural respects:</hi> And imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from hence you inferre your <hi>Ergo,</hi> or <hi>Conclusion.</hi> Now M. Doctor, let the world judge, whether your Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent was, as in this place you cite it: <hi>(That Protestants in the</hi>

            <p>Then I must further tel him, that besides that his corrupt dealing, he hath againe corrupted the wordes of my answere: for my position is, as followeth: <hi>This position (al Protestants</hi>

               <hi>Catholike Religion.</hi> For al men in errour are not Heretikes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they be obstinate as <hi>D. Morton</hi> is, as I haue proued euen by his owne fellowes in religion, the present Protestant wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of England. Secondly, M. Doctor leaueth out the word <hi>(al)</hi> which changeth the nature of the proposition. Thirdly, (as he hath done in a former citation) he turneth the copulatiue proposition into a disiunctiue, altogether altering the sence and truth, of that which is questioned.</p>
            <p>Next let vs heare what he answereth to that last citation, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowing al his arguments at once: his wordes be these: <hi>Which (it followeth) wanteth feete to follow, because there be two</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reply pag. 14. supr.</note>
               <hi>other reasons to proue your doctrine rebellious. The first from the effects we see: the second from an other principle of doctrine, which you generally maintaine.</hi> Which he after expoundeth to be the <hi>Popes excommunications.</hi> Concerning these his two reasons, I <note place="margin">Christian and modest offer, An. 1606. p. 19. Offer of cōfer.</note> haue reasoned so much with him already, that his owne friends haue told him he <hi>doth pittifully shift off the matter in a late reply vnto the Papists.</hi> And so many other Protestants in England at this present, and of chiefe account, haue before condemned him. And himselfe being often charged, how I haue confuted him, in his late Preamble is so silent to deny it, that by his owne law and rules of arguing, he hath graunted victory. And to this passe he is also brought in this place, for he doth not deny but my <hi>consequent (that Priests and Catholikes be innocent, and his positions be slanders)</hi> doth follow vpon the ouerthrow of his Antecedent or Assumption; but he would finde an euasion by those other two reasons, already also confuted.

            <p> Now M.

            <p>Secondly, tel me M. Doctor; of what religion you are, a <note place="margin">D. Morton his Religion most wicked or none by his argumēt</note> Protestant, or of none at al? or what you would be esteemed? for Atheisme or some strange kinde of Infidelity may seeme by your writing (presently to be recited) to be your profession. For first, you affirme of this <hi>Aduertiser</hi> and condemner of your Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and Religion to be worse then the Alcaron, and (conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently) <hi>Turcisme,</hi> these wordes: that <hi>he is sequestred from you,</hi> (the English Protestants) <hi>rather by impotency of passion, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difference in religion.</hi> By which sentence, except you wil deale plainly and say both he and you be of a most wicked and lying religion, which and more you graunt in effect: (because true religion cānot write so slaunderously of true religion, as he hath done of English Protestancy, which you practise;) you haue graunted these and more absurdities against your self: <hi>that Bible</hi> which you vse, and <hi>Religion</hi> which you professe, are worse then the <hi>Alcaron and Turcisme; you deny Christianity; betray the Ghospel; agree with the enimies of our Lord, &amp;c.</hi> for these and more straunge things are affirmed of your religion, by that your Protestant, and so much esteemed friend.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, tel me M. Doctor, with what <hi>species</hi> or kinde of <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:26352:29"/> it of himselfe, must needes be really distinct: But this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroieth the mistery of the Trinity, and the nature of God, making real composition in God, most simple; and further proueth three Gods: because there must needes be three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct essences, which maketh three Gods. For if the Sonne hath his essence of himselfe, then the holy Ghost also, then euery person aswel that of the Father, the Sonne, and holy Gh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st being distinct really, and hauing essences thus really distinct, they make three Gods.</p>
            <p>Secondly, because wheresoeuer there is a substance in God, there is a person, (which is not really distinguished from one another;) by this diuinity it must needes follow, that there is no generation, no procession, and consequently no Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting, no Sonne begotten, no holy Ghost proceeding: And so againe either three Gods, or no God at al.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, howsoeuer the case standeth by their doctrine; that God vvhich these Protestants haue made, must be such an <hi>aggregatum per accidens,</hi> that no Infidels in the world were at any time greater Idolaters, then those Christians, which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship such a God, which be these Protestants. And because <hi>D. Morton</hi> hath Diuinity of as straunge a nature, in an other place of his writings; which is, that <hi>Pater est trinus v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">Morton 1. part. Apolog. concl. in fine.</note>
               <hi>Father is three and one:</hi> Thus I must instruct him of this matter: if that position is true, then seing in this mistery there is only essence and persons, the Father must needes be either three persons and one essence, or three essences and one person. If the first, then there is no person of the Sonne, or of the holy Ghost: because the Father is supposed by this doctrine to haue three, and in the whole Trinity there neither be, nor can be more, for so it should not be a Trinity, but a Quadruplity, Quinquplity, Sexuphty, and except we should likewise diuide them into their Triplicities, and make 9. persons in Diuinity.</p>
            <p>If <hi>D. Morton</hi> meaneth the second, of one person, and three essences, or substances, in the Father; then the Father himselfe must needes be three Gods, because the substance is not many, except the things (in this case Gods) be many: Then seing there is equality in this mistery, and the Sonne and holy Ghost be equal to the Father, there must n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>After this M.

And yet the contents is of that <note place="margin">Reply p. 23. 24.</note> force and efficacy, that by his owne judgement, it stoppeth the clamours of Protestants against Catholike Priests: And yet in these few lines his sincere dealing is in this manner; In the first three lines he maketh none or a defectiue sence. In the fourth and fift he citeth me to say: <hi>We doe not esteeme the Protestants</hi>

               <hi>denied to the Protestants of England, because we doe not esteeme them in that case of Heretikes and excommunicates.</hi> Besides this, he quite omitteth the chiefest reasons of that section; And yet that which he citeth is of such effect and purpose, that it enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth him to these wordes, to his owne confusion: <hi>If al your sect would allow your answere, we should neede no clamour.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seing my answere is so generally allowed, as is shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and this man is not ignorant thereof, al his clamours in his <hi>Positious,</hi> his counterfaite <hi>Ful satisfaction,</hi> his <hi>Preamble</hi> to a further <hi>Encounter,</hi> and the <hi>Encounter</hi> it selfe (if it proue not an <hi>Abortiue)</hi> are needlesse clamours, and with the shame of this Doctor, and such Protestant accusers, to be recalled and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And thus I haue passed ouer al his citations, which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to examine, only one the last consisting but of three lines, excepted: And to justifie my former assertion, that they be al more or lesse corrupted, this also leaueth out the chiefest <note place="margin">Reply pag. 25.</note> and most effectual wordes: <hi>(In whose Dominions they be in force)</hi> in which a great efficacy of the sentence consisted. So that without any one exception, he hath corrupted and falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied my answere in euery citation, in defence of his first Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme, which he planted as the ground and foundation of al.</p>
